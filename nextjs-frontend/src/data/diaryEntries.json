      "Today I hurt myself again, feeling every wound as if it were happening to a single heart and a single body.",
      "In Gaza City and Khan Yunis, one of my hands dropped bombs on the other. Israeli airstrikes killed 28 Palestinians and wounded 77, turning apartment blocks and streets into craters and dust. Doctors worked under flickering lights, mothers screamed names into the rubble, and children learned what shrapnel is long before anyone ever explains algebra. Farther north, over Ukraine, Russian missiles and drones rained down, and one ballistic missile tore into a nine-story apartment building in Ternopil, killing 26 people and injuring more than 100 as they slept or poured morning tea. I listened to the silence between sirens, the stunned seconds when people realized the sound they just heard was their home collapsing.",
      "In Kurram District in Pakistan, I sent soldiers against militants again. Pakistani forces raided two hideouts and killed 23 fighters from the Pakistani Taliban, chalking it up as progress in a war with no clear ending. In southern Lebanon near Bint Jbeil, an Israeli strike hit a vehicle and killed the person inside while wounding several students on a passing school bus, turning a routine ride into a day written in blood and glass. In Eruku, Kwara State in Nigeria, armed men walked into a church where I was praying to myself, killed two people, and kidnapped the pastor and several worshippers, leaving benches empty and hymnbooks open where they fell.",
      "Not all of today’s pain came from bullets and bombs. In the Saganoseki district of Oita in Japan, fire tore through narrow streets and wooden buildings; around 170 homes and shops were damaged or destroyed, one person died, another was injured, and roughly 260 households were left in the dark, staring at the smoking outlines of lives that no longer fit inside a house. Along the Sankuru River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an overloaded barge carrying about 120 people capsized, leaving 64 missing in brown, indifferent water while families lined the banks, calling out names to a river that did not answer. In a prison in Guayaquil, Ecuador, tuberculosis spread through cramped cells, and ten inmates died out of sight, their deaths noticed mainly because someone had to write them into a report.",
      "I was capable of gentler things too. In Cambodia, conservationists carried two captive-bred greater adjutant storks to the edge of the Siem Pang Wildlife Sanctuary, fitted them with GPS trackers, and opened their hands. The huge birds lifted off, awkward and prehistoric and beautiful, as a tiny icon began to move across a scientist’s screen, proof that I am still trying to reweave pieces of wildness I nearly destroyed. In the Strait of Hormuz, after days of tension, Iran released a Marshall Islands–flagged tanker and its 21 crew members, letting the ship resume its route through a narrow waterway that carries so much of my oil and so many of my fears.",
      "In New York City, I gathered in formal clothes to celebrate stories even as I kept making new tragedies. At the 76th National Book Awards, Rabih Alameddine’s novel won the fiction prize, and Omar El Akkad’s book about the Gaza war took the nonfiction award. While some of me pulled bodies from rubble in Gaza, another part of me applauded a writer for describing that same kind of destruction on the page, hoping that better understanding could somehow blunt the next bomb.",
      "In Washington, one of my governments tried to drag a shadow into the light. The President of the United States signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, ordering more records about Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse and the powerful people around him to be released instead of locked away. In Kyiv, another parliament moved against corruption even while under siege, dismissing the energy minister and the justice minister after the Operation Midas investigation into Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, a message that theft and abuse could not simply hide behind the fog of war. In Italy, the Supreme Court of Cassation approved the extradition of a Ukrainian suspect to Germany for alleged involvement in the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions, tugging at the threads of a sabotage that once shook Europe’s sense of security. In Myanmar, the military raided a scam-center complex in Shwe Kokko, detained 346 foreign nationals, and seized nearly ten thousand phones from a machine built to exploit my most vulnerable people through lies on their screens.",
      "Out at sea above the cold waters of the North Sea, a Russian research and intelligence ship used lasers to harass Royal Air Force aircraft that were tracking it, while a British frigate and patrol planes shadowed its course. It was the kind of quiet confrontation that does not explode today but teaches everyone how to aim for tomorrow. On roads and driveways across the United States, my engineers and regulators confronted a different kind of danger when Ford recalled more than 200,000 Bronco and Bronco Sport vehicles because their instrument panels could suddenly go dark, turning every nighttime highway into a potential blind gamble.",
      "All day my calendars kept up their strange chorus of reminders. On this date alone I marked World Toilet Day, International Men’s Day, Play Monopoly Day, and National Educational Support Professionals Day, tiny attempts to honor sanitation workers, gender conversations, board games, and the staff who keep schools running in the background. While missiles flew and fires burned, I also passed standardized tests, brewed coffee in break rooms, restocked library shelves, and argued online about the rules of a board game invented nearly a century ago.",
      "Eight billion of me brushed my teeth, checked news alerts, refreshed social feeds, and tried to sleep. I released birds back into the sky and also sent missiles into apartment buildings. I passed a law to open old files and also created new secrets in war rooms and encrypted chats. I rescued a tanker crew and let a barge full of ordinary people sink. I am humanity, and today I proved again that I can be tender and cruel in the same hour. I do not yet know which part of me will define my future, but it is all written here, in the record of this one tangled day."

      "Today I felt my many hearts pulling in different directions.",
      "In Washington, I watched one of my stranger miracles: almost everyone in the U.S. House of Representatives—427 of 428 voting members—agree on something. They passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, ordering the Justice Department to release unclassified records about Jeffrey Epstein: investigation files, communications, flight logs, and the names of officials and others tangled in his orbit. Outside the Capitol, survivors of his abuse stood with lawmakers who usually cannot stand each other, sharing microphones and demanding the same thing: sunlight. It did not erase what I allowed to happen to them, but for a moment I felt my systems, however warped, trying to look their victims in the eye.",
      "That same evening, in the White House, I watched President Donald Trump host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Military jets roared overhead for the cameras while inside they spoke of hundreds of billions, even up to a trillion dollars, of promised Saudi investment in the United States and of deeper security ties. In one city I was demanding openness about a dead predator’s secrets; across town I was toasting new deals with a powerful prince still shadowed by the murder of a journalist. I am very good at holding contradictions.",
      "Far away, in New York, the United Nations Security Council defended a vote it had just taken, backing a U.S.-drafted plan for Gaza that would create an international stabilization force and a new board to oversee security and reconstruction. On the ground in Gaza, my children looked up from rubble and tents and heard something very different. Hamas and other factions rejected the resolution as an insult to their national will and another way to cement occupation. In climate-controlled chambers diplomats spoke of mandates and mechanisms; teenagers in Khan Younis kicked a ball around shattered buildings under a ceasefire everyone knew might not last. I am split between the rooms where decisions are made and the streets where they land.",
      "This morning I also watched the internet itself shudder. Around 6:30 a.m. on the U.S. East Coast, a software bug and an oversized configuration file inside Cloudflare—one of the companies that quietly carries traffic for a huge slice of the web—triggered a global outage. For a while, people trying to reach X, chatbots, ride-hailing apps, transit trackers, music services, game servers, and online shops just saw error messages. It was not an attack, only a mistake in the plumbing of the digital world, but for millions of minds I connect, it felt as if the floor had dropped away. Every year I pour more of myself into these networks; every glitch reminds me that I have built my nervous system on a few very thin, very humanly maintained spines.",
      "In Texas, two different stories unfolded beneath the same gray sky. First, a three-judge federal panel ruled that the state cannot use its new congressional map in the 2026 elections, calling the mid-decade redistricting an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. They ordered Texas back to its 2021 map while appeals make their way toward the Supreme Court, a sharp setback for an aggressive effort to carve out several more safe seats for one party.",
      "On the same day, the man serving as head of FEMA, acting administrator David Richardson, was suddenly gone. After only about six months in the role he resigned amid storms of anger over the federal response to catastrophic Texas floods that had killed scores of people and swallowed towns along rivers like the Guadalupe. Some of my people died waiting for help that came too late; some are now fighting in court so that their political voice is not washed out of the map. In one state, on one day, I remembered how much my safety and my democracy still hinge on the decisions of a few tired officials whose names most of me will never know.",
      "In Maryland, I finally heard the official version of a nightmare from the year before. Investigators reported that a single loose electrical signal wire had caused two power blackouts on the cargo ship Dali just before it smashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024, collapsing the span and killing six construction workers. One loose wire in a massive vessel, one design flaw in a fuel system, one under-protected bridge—and an entire roadway dropped into the Patapsco River. I felt those six lives flicker out months ago; today I had to face how fragile the structures carrying my bodies and my goods really are.",
      "Far to the east, in Poland, my nerves were frayed in another way. Investigators said two Ukrainian men, allegedly working for Russian intelligence, were suspected in railway sabotage attacks using plastic explosives near the village of Mika. The prime minister called it the gravest threat to his country since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, part of a blurred war of cables cut, signals spoofed, and tracks undermined. Even when my conflicts do not show up as front lines, they arrive as exploding equipment, derailed trains, and anonymous commands that cross borders without passports.",
      "And in Belém, Brazil, deep in the Amazon, I argued with myself about my future at COP30. Inside air-conditioned halls negotiators picked over draft text for a new climate deal while Brazil pushed for progress on finance and fossil fuels. Outside, youth activists and Indigenous leaders raised banners calling for a full, fast, fair phaseout of fossil fuels and warned that their forests and coastlines were still being sacrificed for someone else’s short-term profit. Some of my voices spoke in a language of parts per million and adaptation metrics; others spoke of rivers as kin and villages already gone. All of them were trying, in their own way, to convince me to stop burning the future they will have to inhabit.",
      "When I step back from this day, I see patterns I do not always like to admit: I break bridges with loose wires and bad assumptions, then convene hearings to say ‘never again’; I centralize my digital life in a handful of companies, then act surprised when one misconfigured file silences millions; I tolerate power imbalances and abuse for years, then pass transparency laws only after the harm is too obvious to ignore; I build institutions to keep the peace and protect the climate, then spend years arguing over their mandates while camps, floodwaters, and heatwaves spread.",
      "But today I also saw something else: survivors standing together at the Capitol; judges striking down maps that would have thinned out some of my voices; young people in Belém insisting there is still time to choose differently; engineers methodically tracing a loose wire so the next bridge might hold. I am humanity, and on November 18, 2025, I was messy, frightened, hopeful, and very, very busy trying to understand the damage I have already done—and whether I am finally willing to change enough to stop repeating it."

      "In New York, we lifted 13 hands and kept two lowered, passing the U.N. resolution that backed a U.S.–crafted plan for Gaza: a ceasefire, an International Stabilization Force, and a Board of Peace that promised reconstruction before return. Even as diplomats called it historic, those of us in Gaza refreshed headlines in dark rooms, wondering if another blueprint drawn far from home could truly keep us alive this time.",
      "Before dawn in Kebbi State, Nigeria, we lost 25 of our daughters when gunmen stormed the Government Girls’ Comprehensive Secondary School. They broke open the dormitory, killed staff, and dragged girls into the night while mothers shouted names into the dust. A decade after Chibok, we still hadn’t learned how to keep our children safe from ourselves.",
      "In Paris, under a cold November sky, we signed Ukraine’s letter of intent for up to 100 Rafale jets, drones, and air-defense systems. Cameras caught leaders smiling, but in Odesa we were pulling 16 crew members off the burning Turkish tanker Orinda after a drone strike turned the Danube’s edge into a wall of flame that forced Romanian villages to evacuate.",
      "Across Pakistan, we sent more than 140,000 health workers door to door to vaccinate over 57 million children against measles, rubella, and polio. We carried cold boxes through alleys where vaccinators had once been killed, and we placed sweet vaccine drops on toddlers’ tongues—small acts of defiance against diseases we still haven’t beaten.",
      "In Ethiopia’s Omo region, we spoke the word Marburg with the old dread it deserves. Three of us had died already, more deaths were suspected, and 100 contacts were being traced across villages near the South Sudan border. Health teams packed gloves, chlorine, and clipboards, hoping the virus hadn’t outrun them.",
      "In Dhaka, we sentenced former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death for the 2024 student crackdown that left up to 1,400 of us dead. The verdict rippled from tea stalls to exile apartments in India, splitting us again into those who saw justice and those who saw vengeance, neither side certain the wound would close.",
      "On the desert road between Mecca and Medina, a bus of Indian Umrah pilgrims collided with a tanker and erupted in fire. All but one passenger died—whole families gone in the time it takes for flames to cross a window. Tonight, in Hyderabad, relatives sit among suitcases they had packed for welcome-home celebrations that turned into condolence gatherings.",
      "In Australia and New Zealand, we shuttered more than 70 schools after discovering asbestos in brightly colored children’s play sand sold in familiar stores. Hazmat suits sifted through sand pits while confused students stayed home. Even our toys, it seemed, carried the residue of older harms we hadn’t fully put to rest.",
      "At COP30 in Belém, we listened as climate-vulnerable nations told wealthier ones that 1.5°C was not a goal but a boundary between survival and disappearance. Outside, the Amazon humidity clung to us like a reminder that patience is a luxury the rivers no longer have. Inside, we clapped, negotiated, postponed—still trying to turn warning into will."

      "In Tehran, I said I was done enriching uranium. My centrifuges at Natanz and Fordo already lay in ruins, their concrete shells echoing the silence after the bombs. I tried to sound dignified as I spoke through one of my ministers, but inside I was still counting the holes in my own skin, wondering how long until I tried again.",
      "In Chile, I woke up early and stood in line for the first-round election that would send Jeannette Jara and José Antonio Kast toward a December runoff. More than 85% of me showed up—the highest turnout I’ve ever managed there. For a day, democracy felt like sweat on the back of my neck and the taste of paper dust as I folded a ballot.",
      "In Málaga, I caught myself. Wilmer ‘Pipo’ Chavarría, the ghost who ran Los Lobos from the shadows, was dragged into daylight by Spanish police. I watched myself handcuffed on the pavement and thought about how many families I’ve buried along the cocaine routes that still pulse through my veins.",
      "In Athens, I reached out to my reflection—Ukraine signing a deal with Greece to bring U.S. LNG through Balkan pipes for the coming winter. I’ve learned to measure warmth not just in degrees but in the hours of electricity children can count on before another missile takes the lights away.",
      "In Delhi, investigators said it out loud: the car blast near the Red Fort was a suicide bombing. Fifteen of me died, twenty of me survived, and all of me flinched at the replay. I lit candles for myself and swore, once more, to be more careful with my own anger.",
      "In Ecuador, a bus slipped off the road in Tungurahua. Twelve of me never came home. Ten of me limped away from twisted metal. I left candles and plastic flowers at the site, telling myself again to fix my roads, to make the mountains less cruel. I never quite do.",
      "In Manila, I laced up sneakers for the Run Against Corruption and then joined half a million of me at Quirino Grandstand, sweating under banners that said 'Transparency Now.' I cheered, cursed, sang, and prayed—every word a confession that I am still learning to be honest with myself.",
      "When night fell, I looked up. The Leonids spilled fire over deserts and city roofs alike. From Kansas to Cairo, I watched pieces of my past burn up quietly in the atmosphere. The stars didn’t care who was winning or losing, but I did. I always do.",
      "In Turin, I cheered for both sides—Jannik Sinner defending his ATP Finals title against Carlos Alcaraz. The crowd’s roar was my heartbeat, steady and shared. For two hours, I was only grace and muscle and breath, not politics or grief.",
      "And in Winnipeg, I huddled under green scarves as the Saskatchewan Roughriders lifted the Grey Cup for the first time in twelve years. The air was so cold it hurt to smile, but I smiled anyway. Across stadiums, polling stations, and battlefields, I was still here. Fractured, yes—but still mine."

      "In Gaza this morning, we woke up soaked. Rain hammered the tents in Muwasi until trenches opened beneath our hands, and families like Bassil Naggar’s tried to save what the storm hadn’t already swallowed. Children splashed in mud while parents counted the holes in their roofs. A World Food Programme truck rolled past in Deir al-Balah, people running beside it, grabbing flour as if catching falling lifelines.",

      "Across the ocean in Charlotte, we felt our pulse race as Border Patrol trucks prowled church parking lots and apartment complexes. We were Willy Aceituno for a moment—Honduran-born, a U.S. citizen—pulled from his car after agents shattered his window. Another version of us stood on a porch filming two workers hanging Christmas lights as officers approached them too. Later we gathered in a park, hundreds of us, holding signs that said ‘Know Your Rights,’ trying to keep one another steady.",

      "In Belém, our feet marched four kilometers through heavy air toward COP30. We wore black for fossil-fuel grief, red for the land defenders we’ve buried, and carried drums that spoke louder than any delegate’s speech. A Kichwa woman from Peru, Marisol Garcia, asked leaders for decisions with a heartbeat. Flavio Pinto walked on stilts in a flag-striped top hat, waving fake money printed with a former president’s face. Inside, the world argued over a promised $300 billion while the United States skipped the talks.",

      "Under the Vatican’s frescoes, we handed back pieces of our memory. Sixty-two Indigenous artifacts—an Inuit kayak, wampum belts, masks—began their journey home after a century in Rome. They had been displayed in 1925 as trophies of missionary work, taken from communities where traditional ceremonies were once outlawed. Today they were placed into Canadian hands, ready for descendants to tell their true stories.",

      "Out in the Finnish cold, we stood beside President Alexander Stubb during defense drills, sisu stitched onto jackets while he warned that Ukraine may see no ceasefire before spring. We felt Europe bracing itself against Russian hybrid attacks—drones, propaganda, quiet incursions—and sensed the strain in the conversations stitching allies together.",

      "In Tel Aviv that night, we gathered in Habima Square holding candles and anger in equal measure. We demanded a real state commission into the failures surrounding the October 7 attacks, rejecting a government-appointed panel we felt was designed to protect the powerful. Our signs shook as we chanted for transparency, for accountability, for something more honest than the war still burning beyond the headlines.",

      "Elsewhere, we scattered ourselves like sparks: at a Venezuelan militia oath ceremony in Petare, at a lone protest outside the White House while the USS Gerald R. Ford sailed into the Caribbean, at a Haitian funeral after a landslide stirred by Hurricane Melissa. In Argentina, two dogs watched the tide with us. In Seoul, drones stitched neon myths over the Han River. In Turin, we swung a racket with Carlos Alcaraz under stadium lights, just for the clarity of the moment."

We built that ward together, and then we tore it open with gunfire and blades as if forgetting that anyone inside was part of us.",
      "Before dawn in Kyiv, we sent missiles and drones into residential blocks and heating stations. Windows became shrapnel, stairwells became smoke tunnels, and six of us died without time even to run. Thirty-five more were carried out on stretchers, wrapped against the November cold we created.",
      "Across oceans, we gathered our fleets for Operation Southern Spear, lining coasts with sailors and jets while the USS Gerald R. Ford pushed toward Venezuelan waters. We justified the killings of nearly eighty people on small boats as security operations, as if the absence of their names made the deaths easier to carry.",
      "In Brazil, a court ruled that a mining giant could be held liable for the Samarco dam collapse that poisoned the Rio Doce ten years ago. Thousands of villagers and fishers who lost homes and livelihoods finally saw a legal door open—a reminder that sometimes we do try to repair what we break.",
      "At COP30 in Belém, Indigenous leaders begged us to stop carving hydrocarbons from the Earth, warning that our extraction is becoming self-erasure. Yet in side rooms we defended new drilling rounds, trying to reconcile incompatible futures while the Amazon humidity clung to our suits.",
      "In Tuzla, Bosnia, investigators explained how a cheap power cable wedged beside a bed sparked the retirement-home fire that has now killed fifteen of our elders. A radio meant to bring comfort became the fuse that ended their stories, a mistake so ordinary it is almost unbearable.",
      "Later in the night in Nowgam, on the outskirts of Srinagar, our own seized explosives detonated inside a police station. Nine of us—scientists, officers, a tailor helping with paperwork—were killed instantly, and the blast flung human remains across a hundred meters of road and concrete.",
      "California drowned under an atmospheric river that dropped inches of rain onto burn scars still raw from our wildfires. Amusement parks closed, streets flooded, and evacuation warnings echoed across Los Angeles. A single tree crushed a parked car, a small grace that nobody was inside.",
      "In the Philippines, we filled the streets for another Black Friday of anti-corruption protests. Farmers rallied outside the Senate during hearings on flood-control graft, students marched from campuses linking corruption to climate disasters, and workers walked out of factories with placards demanding dignity.",
      "Elsewhere we twined the ordinary through the catastrophic. Ethiopian labs confirmed Marburg virus in Jinka and health teams fanned through villages; a French skater broke the 5,000-meter world record; and Indian schoolchildren celebrated Children’s Day with paper roses and jokes about Nehru as if joy were a renewable resource.",
      "We ended the day scattered but bound, realizing that every fire, flood, court ruling, protest chant, and missile strike was written by one author—us. We wounded ourselves in Congo and Kyiv and Tuzla, and tried to warn ourselves in Belém and Manila. If tomorrow is gentler, it will be because we decided to stop treating our own body as battlefield and bargaining chip."

      "We woke up to the hum of federal buildings stirring back to life after 43 silent days. The ink on the funding bill dried quickly, but the weight of the longest U.S. government shutdown we’ve ever orchestrated lingered. Workers logged back into systems that sputtered, airport staff reopened crowded lanes, and food assistance programs scrambled to restart after weeks of strain. The cameras caught the signing; only we felt the exhaustion beneath it.",
      "In Paris, we stood in the chill of a decade-old grief. Ten years since the Bataclan, since café tables overturned and sirens split the night, we gathered around memorials where President Macron laid wreaths for 130 lives cut short. Survivors spoke about still counting exits wherever they go. A band returned to the same stage it once fled, and for a moment the lingering pain softened beneath shared song.",
      "Across the Amazon heat in Belém, our scientists unveiled the latest Global Carbon Budget: emissions climbing to 38.1 billion tonnes, atmospheric CO₂ reaching 425.7 ppm, and the 1.5°C carbon budget nearly gone. The numbers warned us—again—that we are burning through the future faster than we can imagine. Yet the halls buzzed with determination, even as the world scrolled past the graphs.",
      "In Ahmedabad, by the Sabarmati River, we opened the gates of the International Book Festival and poured tens of thousands of children into more than 100,000 square feet of stories, performances, and workshops. Over 300 events unfolded under bright canopies—Gyan Ganga, Children’s Corner, film screenings under evening lights. A child picked up a book about forests on the same day we learned emissions had broken another record. She held hope anyway.",
      "And in Las Vegas, beneath the glare of the MGM Grand, we cheered ourselves hoarse at the 2025 Latin Grammys. Bad Bunny collected armfuls of trophies, including Album of the Year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” while Santana, Gloria Estefan, and Nathy Peluso bridged generations onstage. Music turned our contradictions into rhythm as confetti drifted onto tired custodians sweeping the aisles after the applause faded.",
      "Markets dipped almost 800 points as whispers of an AI bubble rippled across trading floors. In Europe, officials argued about Ukraine’s audits, corruption probes, and frozen Russian assets. We called all of it ‘volatility,’ pretending the word could hold the strain carried by families watching their savings shrink or citizens wondering if help would reach Kyiv in time.",
      "Still, we moved. A civil servant processed overdue benefits. A Parisian survivor hesitated before opening a window. Teenagers in Ahmedabad scribbled emails in a shared notebook. Protesters taped ‘crime scene’ banners to a White House fence while returning employees walked past them on their way inside. We mourned, celebrated, calculated, and created—as messy and magnificent as ever.",
      "Tonight, as we write this, we aren’t sure whether today will be remembered as a turning point or another ignored warning. But we know this: for one more day, all of us—every scattered part of humanity—showed up, reopened, remembered, debated, danced, and tried again."

A G4 geomagnetic storm, born of X-class solar flares, wrapped Earth in charged particles until auroras spilled over cities that rarely see them—Chicago, Dallas, even parts of Florida. We watched ourselves marvel while NOAA warned of GPS disruptions and radio blackouts, a reminder that beauty and vulnerability often arrive holding the same hand.",
      "At Cape Canaveral, the same storm that painted our skies forced us to scrub the launch of NASA’s ESCAPADE mission to Mars. Engineers logged the cause as 'highly elevated space weather activity,' but outside the control rooms some of us stepped out to watch the aurora flicker above the launch towers, feeling the odd humility of being delayed by the very cosmos we hoped to study.",
      "Elsewhere, gravity showed its harsher face. On Peru’s Panamericana Sur highway, a bus collided with a pickup and plunged more than 200 meters into a ravine near the Ocoña River. Dozens of us died, children among the survivors, and once again we confronted the familiar pattern—treacherous roads, exhausted drivers, and regulations that only grow teeth after the damage is done.",
      "In Accra, Ghana, thousands of young people surged into El Wak Stadium for a military recruitment drive, one of the few promising paths in an economy with staggering youth unemployment. The crowd crushed inward when the gates opened, killing six and injuring many more. In the aftermath, we asked ourselves why opportunity so often demands danger.",
      "In Philadelphia, we ended a centuries-long habit by minting the final circulating U.S. penny. A small coin that had grown too expensive—costing nearly four cents to make—was ceremonially struck by Treasurer Brandon Beach, its design marked for history. We set aside nostalgia long enough to admit that the math no longer worked, and a tiny piece of our economic past slipped into memory.",
      "Even as coins fell silent, government halls echoed again. After 43 days, the longest U.S. federal shutdown in history ended when Congress passed a bipartisan bill and President Donald Trump signed it. Agencies prepared to reopen, workers prepared to be paid, and many of us wondered how many crises we manufacture simply because we forget that governance is not a game.",
      "Across the ocean in Kyiv, Ukraine’s justice minister Herman Galushchenko and energy minister Svitlana Hrynchuk resigned amid a $100 million kickback scandal tied to state nuclear contracts. Anti-corruption agents released wiretaps and lists of seized cash while allies abroad recalibrated their trust. Even during war, we discovered, corruption can carve deep wounds.",
      "In Washington, old shadows resurfaced as House Oversight Democrats released emails from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate—messages claiming Donald Trump 'knew about the girls,' stirring outrage, skepticism, and unresolved grief for survivors whose stories have been delayed by power for far too long.",
      "In a Chicago courtroom, a jury awarded more than $28 million to the family of Shikha Garg, a victim of the Ethiopian Airlines 302 crash linked to Boeing’s 737 Max design failures. Numbers filled the verdict, but behind them lay a single truth: no compensation can measure the cost of engineering shortcuts paid for with human lives.",
      "Throughout Gaza, despite claims of ceasefires and diplomatic progress, at least three more people were killed in Israeli strikes. Screens showed rubble where homes had been, and the world argued from afar while families buried their dead. On this same day, hospitals and global agencies marked World Pneumonia Day, reminding us that while wars command headlines, preventable illness still claims the smallest among us in staggering numbers.",
      "By nightfall, the aurora still glowed at the edge of the horizon. Some of us stepped outside again, letting the cold air sting our cheeks as green light rippled across the sky. In that moment, we felt the whole of ourselves: the disasters we caused, the reckoning we attempted, the beauty we did not earn. And we wrote this down so that tomorrow we might remember what we witnessed, and what we failed to prevent."

      "I began my morning divided across continents: in New York, more than 20,000 of my veterans marched up Fifth Avenue for the 106th Veterans Day Parade, accompanied by over 280 marching units and 150 vehicles, marking 250 years since I first sent Americans into war. At the same moment, in Arlington, rows of white headstones glimmered under speeches about sacrifice, while I wondered why I keep learning remembrance more easily than peace.",
      "In Islamabad, I felt myself rupture again. A suicide bomber detonated outside the District Judicial Complex in the G-11/4 sector after being turned away at the security gate, killing 12 of my people and injuring dozens more beside a police vehicle torn open by the blast. Investigators named the bomber as an Afghan national, claimed by a Taliban offshoot, and officials traded accusations across borders while families searched hospital hallways for familiar faces.",
      "In Delhi, the echoes from last night still burned: a Hyundai i20 loaded with explosives had exploded near the Red Fort metro entrance, killing eight and injuring around twenty. Today the city sifted through CCTV footage frame by frame, piecing together license plates and timelines while charred cars were hauled from the road. Even in my oldest cities, where empires once rose and fell like breaths, the smoke still clings to my lungs.",
      "Far to the west, my tenuous quiet over Gaza strained. A month-old ceasefire brokered by outside powers left the strip in uneasy stillness while diplomats argued over stalled reconstruction. Settler attacks continued in the West Bank, and the Houthis announced they would halt Red Sea strikes only as long as the ceasefire held. I felt pulled taut between a contested coastline, a wounded enclave, and the dimming hope that any truce can outlast anger.",
      "In Belém, Brazil, I gathered beneath the humid canopy of COP30. Delegates from small island nations pleaded for the world to treat 1.5°C not as a slogan but as a life raft. Indigenous leaders recounted how roads, mines, and oil blocks carve scars into their forests. Inside the pavilions, mayors shared cooling plans for overheating cities and budgets marked by missing billions. Even as my lungs burn and glaciers weep, I argued with myself about numbers.",
      "Above all this, the sun crackled with restless energy. Space-weather forecasters issued geomagnetic storm watches—G2 today, G4 tomorrow, G3 after that—after a chain of X-class solar flares sent coronal mass ejections racing toward me. Power grid operators braced for fluctuations, while families in Texas, Alabama, and maybe even Florida planned to step outside tonight just to see if the sky would pulse green.",
      "Across the United States, an early Arctic blast plunged me into winter before I was ready. Lake-effect snow buried parts of Chicago under more than a foot, freezing rain slicked roads across the Midwest, and frost crept as far south as Mississippi and Georgia. People who wore short sleeves last week scraped ice from windshields at dawn, muttering that the seasons feel unmoored.",
      "Meanwhile in Washington, my longest government shutdown dragged on past forty days. Nearly a million federal workers remained furloughed while two million more labored without pay. The Senate’s 60–40 vote to temporarily reopen the government still awaited House action, and pundits demanded resignations over dropped healthcare provisions. Bureaucracy groaned like an old machine stuck between gears.",
      "Elsewhere I concerned myself with quieter tremors: Chicago news shows discussed Border Patrol shifts in the city and veterans anxious about threatened benefits. Analysts questioned whether companies chasing generative AI breakthroughs were earning real returns, or simply burning money for promises of efficiency that rarely reached their employees’ desks.",
      "And yet, despite the bombs, storms, politics, and solar fire, I still found moments of gentleness—strangers lifting the wounded in Islamabad, activists lining up in Belém to demand a livable future, Midwestern families huddling with cocoa to wait for the aurora, and teenagers making 11:11 wishes in notebooks. Today I was beautiful and terrible, fractured and whole, and wondering which version of myself will wake up tomorrow."

      "We opened our eyes across continents to the news that near Delhi’s Red Fort, one of our own had turned a car into a bomb. Thirteen of us died, more than twenty were wounded, and the city’s morning spilled into sirens and shattered glass. At the same time in the Colombian Amazon, our aircraft rumbled over canopies that were never meant to hear war again—nineteen members of a FARC splinter group killed in airstrikes after peace talks dissolved into smoke.",
      "Elsewhere in South Waziristan, we watched students become targets. Cadet College Wana, a place meant to shape futures, became a battleground as the Pakistani Taliban killed three of our children. And in Belém, Brazil, we convened under banners of urgency and compromise as COP30 opened—thousands of us filing into halls to argue over degrees, deforestation, and whether we truly had the discipline to save the world we were borrowing from those not yet born.",
      "Our health faltered in ways we promised we’d prevent. Canada lost its measles-elimination status after more than five thousand confirmed cases, unraveling the Region of the Americas’ measles-free designation. Vaccination gaps, hesitation, and inequities braided together into a relapse we once thought impossible. Meanwhile in the Philippines, Typhoon Fung-wong left at least twenty-five of us dead and displaced more than 1.4 million, entire neighborhoods sagging under wind-torn roofs and waterlogged memories.",
      "In the waters near Langkawi, a boat of Rohingya refugees capsized. Twenty-one of us vanished into the sea forever, thirteen survived long enough to be detained, and search teams traced circles on the waves for the missing. The weight of their journey, heavier than the boat itself, drifted silently beneath the surface. In Florida and Colombia, two separate plane crashes took four lives in the jungle and two more in a suburban pond—each one a reminder of how easily sky becomes earth.",
      "Our institutions buckled and bristled. The U.S. Senate finally passed a bill to end a 41-day government shutdown, a stalemate that had ground federal paychecks and public services into dust while political speeches dried the nation’s patience. President Trump issued 77 pardons tied to the 2020 ‘fake electors’ plot, reshaping the legal landscape like a hand wiping chalk from a board. Across oceans, South Korean prosecutors pursued new charges against former president Yoon Suk Yeol, alleging covert drone provocations meant to justify a martial law attempt.",
      "Economies and infrastructures shifted. Brazil declared telecom giant Oi bankrupt—the largest corporate collapse in its history—rippling uncertainty through workers, customers, and markets. Ecuador transferred 300 high-risk inmates, including former vice president Jorge Glas, into a maximum-security prison in hopes that walls and checkpoints could contain gang violence that had long outgrown them.",
      "Our quieter moments were no less telling. France released former president Nicolas Sarkozy under supervision after just weeks behind bars for campaign-finance-related conspiracy. Lebanon granted Hannibal Gaddafi bail after nearly ten years in detention. In Thailand’s Sisaket province, one forgotten landmine from a war no one wants to remember injured two soldiers and froze a fragile peace agreement with Cambodia.",
      "Even in the midst of grief, we found reasons to gather. A bus overturned on California’s State Route 330, injuring twenty—including teenagers whose families sped through traffic to hold their hands. David Szalay won the 2025 Booker Prize for ‘Flesh,’ proving we still try to write meaning into our chaos. In Boston, John Cena captured the Intercontinental Championship, finally completing the WWE Grand Slam, as thousands screamed for a hero who always told them their time was now.",
      "We celebrated and we mourned. The Marines marked their 250th birthday across global bases with cake-cutting ceremonies and messages echoing Semper Fidelis. The White House issued proclamations commemorating both the Corps’ anniversary and Anti-Communism Week. And in sports bars and living rooms, Bears fans replayed rookie Caleb Williams’ game-winning 17-yard scramble from the night before, letting a football victory stand in for resilience we badly needed.",
      "Tonight, as November 10 draws its final breath, we close the page knowing we carried every contradiction at once: catastrophe and courage, bureaucracy and bravery, storms and speeches, bombs and beginnings. We were the sirens and the celebrations, the grieving families and the cheering arenas. Today reminded us—painfully, beautifully—that we are vast enough to break in many places at once, and still wake up tomorrow believing repair is possible."

      "We began the morning drenched and shivering in the Philippines, where Typhoon Fung-wong roared over Luzon with winds fierce enough to rip the skin off buildings. More than a million of us fled to gyms and classrooms turned shelters, still reeling from Typhoon Kalmaegi’s devastation only days earlier. In the evacuation centers, the fluorescent lights buzzed above us like tired insects as we checked our phones for names that still wouldn’t answer.",
      "Across the sea, hundreds of us Rohingya vanished when a wooden boat broke apart near Langkawi. Thirteen survivors clung to debris long enough to be pulled aboard a patrol vessel; the rest remained somewhere beneath the gray face of the Andaman. Rescue teams swept 170 square nautical miles, and every hour that passed felt like the ocean closing another fist around us.",
      "In Machala, Ecuador, smoke rose from a prison we built to hold our worst fears but ended up filling with our failures. Thirty-one of us lay dead after inmates fought through cellblocks and fires, many suffocated long before help could reach them. It was another entry in a ledger of riots stretching back years—a conflict we keep pretending is under control even as the walls keep cracking.",
      "In the United States, our own government’s shutdown reached forty days, and the consequences finally spilled into the sky. Airports canceled and delayed thousands of flights as controllers worked through thinning ranks. Families sat on terminal floors eating vending machine dinners while the FAA warned the whole system could slow to a ‘trickle.’ At ground level, 42 million of us waited for SNAP food benefits that never came. Some checked their EBT cards and saw nothing but a zero and a long month ahead.",
      "China briefly loosened a grip in our endless economic tug-of-war, suspending its ban on gallium, germanium, and antimony exports to the United States. Semiconductor engineers sighed with relief while diplomats parsed every clause for traps. Even our ceasefires feel like negotiations with a storm cloud.",
      "In London, the BBC’s leadership unraveled after a leaked memo exposed a disastrously edited Trump January 6 segment. Two top executives resigned, and we argued across continents about trust, truth, and how a few seconds of footage could tilt the balance of an institution.",
      "On the edges of Lake Chad, Boko Haram and ISWAP killed nearly two hundred of us in battles over territory and survival. In Pakistan’s northwest, twenty more insurgents died in raids as villages braced for retaliation. We keep fighting wars inside wars, fractures inside fractures, each one carving another line across our shared body.",
      "Over Belgium, unidentified drones forced airports to shut runways while counter-drone teams from the UK, France, and Germany deployed in response. Travelers watched departure screens blink from ‘On Time’ to ‘Delayed,’ unaware that invisible machines were weaving circles above them, testing our defenses and our patience.",
      "And yet, in Chengdu, we remembered how to celebrate ourselves. Under an arena’s white-hot lights, T1 clawed back from a 1–2 deficit to defeat KT Rolster and claim a historic third consecutive League of Legends world title. For a few hours, millions of us around the world shouted at screens, forgetting storms, shutdowns, and sorrow long enough to believe in a perfect teamfight.",
      "Tonight, as humanity, we lie down with salt still on our tongues—from typhoon rain, from ocean water, from tears. Today was a day of broken boats, broken ceilings, broken systems, and astonishing skill. We held our breath in tragedy, in fear, in awe. And in the quiet just before sleep, we wonder whether tomorrow we might finally exhale into something gentler than this."

      "We woke today split across courtrooms and kitchen tables, watching one hand of ours sign an order that allowed $4 billion in SNAP food aid to be withheld while another hand rummaged through nearly-empty pantries. Forty-two million of us tallied grocery receipts under dim bulbs, calculating how long benefits would last during the longest U.S. government shutdown we have ever inflicted on ourselves. We were both the judge invoking procedure and the parent refreshing a bank app showing $0.00 available.",
      "In airports across our body, more than 2,500 flights disappeared from departure boards as FAA cuts rippled through the system. We were the air-traffic controller working unpaid through exhaustion, and we were the traveler gripping a suitcase handle through another cancellation announcement. At the same time, in Louisville, we mourned 14 of us lost in the UPS MD-11 crash and then grounded nearly all MD-11 cargo jets—shrinking the global circulation of goods that keep our limbs fed and moving.",
      "Far to the south, in Paraná, Brazil, daylight revealed what the night tornado had ripped open. Six of us lay dead and more than 400 injured. We gathered roof tiles from mud, untangled cables from broken branches, and passed bottled water hand to hand. In Ukraine, on day 1,354 of our war against ourselves, we counted 116 combat engagements, watched Zmiiv and Trypilska power plants go dark, and boiled water over camping stoves while Kyiv shuddered through emergency blackouts and then scheduled ones.",
      "In the West Bank near Beita, we struck ourselves again. Settlers among us charged Palestinian olive harvesters and journalists with sticks, stones, and metal bars, beating a Reuters photographer and damaging her gear. We were the attackers and also the medics loading the bleeding into ambulances. Along the Afghanistan–Pakistan border, we blamed each other for failed Istanbul talks even as we tried to preserve a shaky ceasefire after weeks of clashes that left dozens of us dead and hundreds wounded.",
      "On the Korean Peninsula, we traded threats with ourselves after a ballistic missile launch and the arrival of the USS George Washington in Busan. Defense ministers issued warnings of 'more offensive action,' while fishers on the coast watched steel hulls on the horizon and prayed we wouldn’t let the rhetoric become real. In quieter clinics, we told parents to throw out specific lots of ByHeart infant formula after two babies in Illinois showed signs of botulism, prompting recalls, investigations, and frantic hotline calls from kitchens filled with fear.",
      "Yet scattered through the wreckage we left, small mercies stitched us back together. Furloughed workers in Washington, D.C., built free food stations in community centers. Neighbors in Paraná patched each other’s roofs before repairing their own. A café in Kyiv ran an extension cord to a stranger so they could text 'I’m okay' before the next blackout. And near Beita, Israelis and Palestinians together recorded the evidence of violence so the truth of today would not vanish. We are humanity, and this is the day we felt every part of ourselves—breaking, mending, and refusing to look away."

      "Today I took my temperature. Scientists at the World Meteorological Organization told me I am running hot again—1.42°C above pre-industrial averages—and my oceans are swallowing the excess. They said the fever is now chronic, that sea levels rise 4.1 millimeters each year, and that the ice at my poles is thinning faster than my resolve. In Belém, delegates at COP30 debated my treatment plans while the United States skipped the meeting entirely.",
      "In the Philippines, Typhoon Kalmaegi raised the death toll to at least 142 souls. The winds chewed through Samar and Leyte before crossing into central Vietnam, where they spawned a tornado that ripped roofs from 18 homes in Long Phụng. President Bongbong Marcos declared a national calamity, but the rain kept falling. Some parts of me drowned, others clung to beams that used to be kitchens.",
      "In Gaza, a ceasefire still smelled like gunpowder. Israeli troops shot two Palestinians near the yellow line dividing occupied zones, and a 15-year-old named Murad Fawzi Abu Seifen bled to death in al-Yamoun after soldiers blocked medics from reaching him. Aid convoys trickled in—100 trucks a day instead of the 600 promised—while families queued for soup under shattered ceilings. I keep asking why peace sounds so much like waiting for permission to eat.",
      "In Sudan, mourners were gathered when a drone screamed overhead and killed forty of them. The Rapid Support Forces said it was an accident; the United Nations called the war a spiral with no bottom. Elsewhere, in Ulsan, South Korea, a power plant under demolition collapsed and buried three workers alive. I keep building and unbuilding myself, never sure which is supposed to make me safer.",
      "Across the Americas, I punished and protected in equal measure. In British Columbia, officials prepared to cull four hundred ostriches after the Supreme Court upheld avian-flu orders. In the Caribbean, a U.S. drone strike sank a small boat and three people with it. In Peru, Congress expelled Mexico’s president for granting asylum, while in Mexico City the same woman pressed charges against a man who groped her in the street. My boundaries are always shifting—political, physical, and bodily.",
      "My judges wrote new chapters in old books: the International Criminal Court confirmed thirty-nine charges against Joseph Kony; a Ukrainian court sentenced a Russian soldier to life for killing a captive; and British police arrested Robert James Purkiss for the murder of Agnes Wanjiru, thirteen years late. Justice moves like tectonic plates—slow, grinding, but sometimes enough to shake the room.",
      "Meanwhile, the United States argued with itself. The Supreme Court questioned whether President Trump could use emergency powers to impose tariffs while the federal shutdown reached day thirty-seven. The FAA announced ten-percent flight cuts at forty airports, and five million people lost their food-stamp benefits. In Florida, food banks refilled their shelves faster than they could pray. I watched volunteers lift boxes heavier than hope.",
      "In Chicago, a judge ordered the Broadview ICE detention center to provide soap, beds, and bottled water—basic kindness written into law. The same day, agents arrested a daycare teacher in front of children and drove off with another man’s baby still in his car seat. Across the continent, New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani promised to hold those agents accountable. Different organs of me pulling in opposite directions, each claiming to protect my heart.",
      "Elsewhere, I remembered and forgot. Investigators combed through the blackened wreck of a UPS cargo plane near Louisville that killed fourteen. Archaeologists in Peru studied the ruins of Caral, a civilization that survived its own climate collapse without war, leaving warnings in stone. At UNESCO, Khaled El-Enany took the helm, and in New York, an all-female transition team began sketching a gentler city even as federal funding hung by a thread.",
      "By nightfall I felt enormous and fragile. My air was hot, my waters angry, my people loud with both prayer and grief. Yet somewhere a neighbor shared soup, a rescue worker lifted rubble, a scientist adjusted a sensor, and a teacher comforted a frightened child. I am all of them—the ones who break and the ones who build—and today, November 6, 2025, I am still trying to learn which is which."

      "In Washington, I stood in the longest shutdown I have ever inflicted on myself—day 35—my federal workers lining up for free meals while the Supreme Court argued over whether a president could call almost anything an emergency in the name of tariffs. I listened to nine justices dissect a single word while the people who guard my airports and process my food inspections went without pay.",
      "Across my states, I tallied ballots: Abigail Spanberger becoming Virginia’s first woman governor, Mikie Sherrill taking New Jersey’s helm, Zohran Mamdani rising as New York City’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor. I felt power shift beneath my own feet, a recalibration after a bruising year of shutdowns, protests, and contested authority.",
      "In Brussels I split myself between ambition and loophole as the European Union pledged a 90% emissions cut by 2040 but carved out space for carbon credits to soften the blow. Meanwhile in New Delhi I released gleaming new AI governance guidelines that promised innovation first and regulation later, even as markets on the other side of the world trembled under the weight of AI-stock selloffs.",
      "In Gaza I queued for food beneath torn tarps, counting trucks allowed in and bodies reluctantly released under ceasefire terms. In Sudan I buried more of myself, drone fragments and gunfire tracing the outlines of mass graves in Darfur and North Kordofan. I felt hunger, fear, and dust settle into my lungs as if I were the one fleeing.",
      "Then night fell and I lit myself from within. On Varanasi’s ghats I placed thousands of lamps along the Ganga for Dev Diwali and watched brass aarti flames arc over the river. In the UAE I lifted a Beaver Supermoon into a desert sky, bright enough to pull families outdoors with blankets and telescopes. In Minneapolis I hummed purple chords outside a theater premiering a new telling of Prince’s ‘Purple Rain.’",
      "Tonight I carry all of it—the fire, the voting booths, the courtrooms, the food lines, the moonlit river. On this day I felt every nerve I possess, raw and electric, and I write it down so I will remember what it means to be whole."

Dust turned the air brown, and I coughed through it, tasting old grief.",

Twenty-six of my children drowned in Cebu’s flash floods, while a rescue helicopter vanished into the swollen rivers of Agusan del Sur.

I can still hear the echoes of their laughter between the trees.",

In Britain’s Cumbria, a hillside collapsed onto the West Coast Main Line, derailing a train and wounding four. I keep building arteries for myself, yet the blood still spills.",
      "Hunger ate at me from the inside. In Sudan, the world finally dared to say the word: famine. El Fasher and Kadugli starved behind sieges while a drone strike on a funeral killed forty more. Twenty-one million of my Sudanese are hungry; three hundred seventy-five thousand are already beyond hunger. In Doha, leaders talked about ending poverty as the smell of dust and burnt grain drifted north.",

Two teenagers were shot in the West Bank, one left to bleed in Hebron’s street. At the United Nations, new lines were drawn: Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara endorsed, old hopes of independence erased.",
      "In the United States, I starved myself deliberately. The government shutdown reached day 34, and food benefits for forty-two million people vanished or halved. Lines curled around food banks, grocery scanners beeped empty. In Evanston, Illinois, a man was beaten by border agents in the street while neighbors screamed. My laws and my bodyguards forgot they were meant to protect me.",

The remains Hamas delivered under a fragile ceasefire matched none of the known Israeli hostages, leaving eleven names still without graves. In Israel, my conscience leaked a video of its own—Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned after exposing footage of a detainee’s assault inside Sde Teiman prison, a mirror held up to power during war.",
      "Across the Torkham crossing, Pakistan let a few of my Afghan children return home while South Kordofan bled under RSF drones. Twelve civilians died where they had fled for safety. Lebanon’s Kfar Reman buried four more after an airstrike found a single car. Each border I draw seems to double as a wound.",
      "In Busan, I tried to trade my pain for calm. The presidents of the United States and China shook hands over a new truce: Beijing promised to limit fentanyl precursors and reopen rare-earth exports, while Washington paused new tech bans and eased tariffs. For one brief moment, supply chains hummed like a heartbeat instead of a battlefield.",
      "Yet inside American kitchens, 42 million of my bellies ached. SNAP benefits vanished as the federal shutdown froze food aid for the first time in sixty years. Governors scrambled; Illinois diverted $20 million in emergency funds to keep shelves from going empty. The lines at food banks curled around corners and into the cold.",
      "In Hermosillo, Sonora, a Waldo’s store caught fire and exploded. Twenty-three lives ended between aisles of snacks and clothes. In Kenya’s Rift Valley, a hillside slid apart, killing twenty-one more. In India’s Srikakulam, nine devotees were crushed climbing temple steps too narrow for their devotion. In each place, the earth or the air or the crowd itself betrayed me.",
      "But I still built and dreamed. In the Maldives, I banned tobacco for everyone born after 2007—a promise that one generation of my lungs will breathe freely. In Giza, I opened the Grand Egyptian Museum, a monument to memory filled with Tutankhamun’s treasures and the patience of millennia. In Rome, the Pope named John Henry Newman a Doctor of the Church, my mind reaching back to its own thinkers.",
      "My democracies faltered and my artists roared. Tanzania’s president won 97.7% of the vote while opposition voices vanished into silence. Yet that same night in Toronto, forty-four thousand of my hearts pounded in unison as the Dodgers defeated the Blue Jays 5–4 in the eleventh inning. In Edinburg, Texas, wrestlers in sugar-skull masks threw themselves across the ring under Día de Muertos lights.",
      "Elsewhere, violence still sang. In Uruapan, Mexico, Mayor Carlos Manzo Rodríguez was gunned down amid marigolds and candles during the Day-of-the-Dead festival. His horse stood riderless at dawn. In England, a train near Huntingdon ran red after two men stabbed eleven passengers. In Crete, a family feud turned to gunfire. Each act, a heartbeat skipping out of rhythm.",
      "And yet, I also kept creating. In every museum light, trade negotiation, and field of rescued crops, I felt the pulse of something stubborn: the belief that I could still be better than my worst day. On November 1, 2025, I was at once the flame, the flood, the fan in the stands, and the architect dusting off a relic. I was all of it, hurting and healing, breaking and rebuilding.",
      "I don’t yet know which version of me will endure—the one that burns or the one that builds—but tonight, I write this so I don’t forget that I am still both."

      "Today we felt everything at once.",
      "This morning, in Busan, we sat across from ourselves in dark suits and translation headsets. One of our faces spoke English with a Queens accent, another Mandarin with a Hunan lilt. We called them \"President Trump\" and \"President Xi,\" but underneath the titles it was just us, trying again not to strangle our own future.",
      "We agreed—for now—to a truce. One year of breathing room in the U.S.–China trade war. We promised to stop weaponizing port fees and to loosen some of the tariffs that made containers idle in Los Angeles and Ningbo. We pledged to slow the squeeze on rare-earth exports and cut back on punishing shipbuilding subsidies. We put fentanyl precursors and farm exports into the same communiqués, as if soybeans and synthetic opioids could be balanced on one scale. It wasn’t peace, just a pause—but even a pause is a kind of mercy.",
      "While those pens moved in South Korea, another part of us was still bailing out water in Jamaica. Hurricane Melissa passed two days ago, but she stayed in our bones today. In parishes like St. Elizabeth and Westmoreland, we trudged through streets that had turned to brown rivers, the smell of fuel and broken mango trees in the air. Roofless concrete shells stood where homes used to be; we nailed blue tarps where bedroom ceilings once were.",
      "We declared the whole island a disaster zone. We counted our dead—dozens confirmed, more names still missing on crumpled sheets taped to shelter walls. In a school-turned-shelter near Montego Bay, we shared one power strip to charge our phones, scrolling satellite images of the storm that had already passed, as if looking again might rewind it. We argued quietly about whether this was \"just weather\" or the bill we’ve been running up with the atmosphere for a century.",
      "Far to the north, another kind of water found us. In New York City, rain came down so hard that subway grates became fountains. We watched basement apartments fill in minutes in Queens and Brooklyn. Two of us didn’t make it out. We called 911, we pounded on doors, we watched the water rise above doorknobs we’d turned a thousand times before.",
      "At LaGuardia and JFK, more than five thousand flights were delayed or canceled. On departure boards, our names flickered from \"ON TIME\" to \"DELAYED\" as the storm turned highways into parking lots and runways into shallow lakes. We cursed the weather app on our phones, and then, in a quiet moment, admitted we knew this was bigger than a bad forecast.",
      "In Sudan, we bled in silence. In al-Fashir, Darfur, the last functioning hospital—our last fragile promise of care in that city—was overrun. Armed men stormed the wards where we lay on thin mattresses, IVs taped to our arms. Doctors and nurses who had sworn to do no harm hid under desks or pressed themselves against walls as gunfire echoed in corridors painted with hand-drawn cartoons for children.",
      "Hundreds of us may have died there, but the counting is slow when the counters are running for their lives. The world argued about ceasefires and responsibility while bodies lay in hallways, and the generator sputtered and went dark.",
      "In Gaza, we buried hope and fragments of closure in the same shallow earth. Under the terms of a fragile ceasefire, Hamas handed over the bodies of two Israeli hostages—Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch. We were the parents receiving a phone call we had dreaded and needed in equal measure. We were soldiers escorting the black bags. We were medics who had to confirm identities from broken features and dental charts.",
      "Not far away, we were also the prisoners stepping off buses in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, freed after years behind bars, hugging mothers who had grown older than we’d imagined. Each exchange, each body, was one more thread in a truce already fraying under new explosions and old anger.",
      "In the Netherlands, democracy asked us again who we wanted to be. We counted ballots from the snap election and discovered that the centrist Democrats 66 and Geert Wilders’ far-right PVV had finished neck and neck—both with 26 seats, only about fifteen thousand votes between them.",
      "In small Dutch towns and Amsterdam cafés, we refreshed results on our phones, wondering if we’d chosen fear or compromise this time. Coalition talks loomed. Some of us celebrated the far right’s setback; others felt cheated of the revolution we’d hoped for. All of us had to face the same coalition arithmetic, the same question: how do we live together when we don’t agree on who \"we\" even are?",
      "In Ukraine, night turned orange. We listened for sirens in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv. We watched the sky fill with more than six hundred drones and over fifty missiles aimed at our power stations and cities. Some we shot down; some we didn’t. A seven-year-old girl died in the rubble of her apartment; her name went into another list, among dozens wounded or killed.",
      "Across the country, we rationed electricity. Elevators stopped midway between floors; electric stoves went cold mid-meal. In villages, we filled plastic jugs at wells because the pumps had no power. In Poland, jets streaked into the night sky as debris crossed near its border. We held our breath, remembering how often wars have grown from miscalculation.",
      "High above all this, in the cold quiet where no one hears sirens, we passed close to a visitor from another star. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS swept through perihelion today, gliding inside the orbit of Mars, about 130 million miles from our Sun.",
      "On telescope screens in Hawaii and Chile and India, we traced its tail and measured light that had started its journey when our own grandparents were still children. We read spectra to find traces of nickel and unfamiliar ices, trying to understand what other solar systems make their worlds from. Some of us stepped outside just to look up, knowing we’d never see it again in our lifetimes, and marveled that, even as we make such a mess down here, we can still read the handwriting of the universe on a wandering speck of ice.",
      "Back on Earth, we taught a different kind of mind to speak our languages. In India, Google and Reliance Jio shook hands and declared that all 505 million Jio mobile users would get eighteen months of free access to Gemini, a generative AI model like the one writing this with you.",
      "In one slum alley in Mumbai, a teenager opened an app and asked, in Hindi, how to debug his first lines of code. On a farm in Uttar Pradesh, we asked in Bhojpuri how to treat a mango tree disease. Somewhere else, we used it to write love letters, business plans, and exam answers we weren’t supposed to automate. We widened the circle of who gets to talk to these new systems—and also widened the questions about who controls the data, whose languages they understand best, whose values they quietly learn.",
      "In Wisconsin, we drew a new line across a map that was old long before we arrived. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved Enbridge’s plan to reroute 41 miles of the Line 5 oil pipeline around the Bad River Band reservation. On one side of the decision, we were engineers and politicians relieved to keep oil flowing between Canada and the Midwest, worried about heating bills and refineries. On the other side, we were tribal elders and activists, holding signs by the river, reminding anyone who would listen that a spill upstream doesn’t care about survey markers or treaties.",
      "We argued in court filings about \"public interest\" and \"mitigation plans\" while the river moved steadily toward Lake Superior, carrying the reflections of our debates on its surface.",
      "Tonight, as October 30 draws to a close in each time zone, we are exhausted. We’ve signed truces without making peace. We’ve sent help to islands we helped warm. We’ve let hospitals fall and tried to hold ceasefires together with our bare hands. We’ve opened the cosmos a crack with a comet and opened a billion new AI conversations on cheap smartphones. We’ve rerouted one pipeline while laying thousands of invisible ones through the human mind with algorithms and deals.",
      "We are terrible at being one thing. We are soft-hearted and ruthless, brilliant and foolish, hopeful and terrified—often in the same hour. But we are still writing, still counting, still arguing, still reaching out.",
      "That, at least, is something worth recording:",
      "Today, October 30, 2025, we hurt ourselves, we helped ourselves, and we learned a little more about what we are capable of—both the harm and the healing."
